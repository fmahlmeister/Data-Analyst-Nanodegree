    "\n",
    "- Guarulhos city is getting hotter and hotter over the years, the trend has been consistently positive, and it looks like will continue growing in the next few years;<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The world is also getting hotter and hotter over the years, a consistent positive trend could be seen from the last 200 years.\n",
    "It can’t be just coincidence that this positive trend starts exactly when the world started to change because of the industrial revolution, which started at the middle of the XVIII century and got fully developed near to the middle of the XIX century.\n",
    "Because unknown reasons it got a negative slope between 1810 and 1830, breaking a weird previous positive trend (from 1770 to 1810). The hidden causes of these events couldn’t be explained by these data, to make any conclusion about that we need more information about the world at this time or about the data collection;<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The city where I live is getting hotter than the world temperature, meaning that even the world has a large influence on the local temperature, we are also partly guilty about that.\n",
    "Looking for the last 20 years’ slope (which is the highest of all the time), I got worried about the next years, because I don’t see any local initiative in a way to reduce its growing and the temperature at the summer could be a danger for the population;<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- This study has shown some alarming points about our influence on the climate changes and about its importance of having a reliable data to achieve reliable conclusion, in order to make decisions that could impacts the whole world."
