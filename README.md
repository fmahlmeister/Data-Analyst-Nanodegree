# Data Analyst Nanodegree

### Felipe Mahlmeister

This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

### Part 1: Introduction to Data Analysis

Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

- Project: [Explore Weather Trends](https://github.com/fmahlmeister/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/1.Introduction-to-Data-Analysis/1.1.Explore-Weather-Trends.ipynb)
- Project: [Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/fmahlmeister/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/1.Introduction-to-Data-Analysis/1.2.Investigate-a-Dataset.ipynb)

### Part 2: Practical Statistics
Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.

- Project: [Analyze Experiment Results](https://github.com/fmahlmeister/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/2.Practical-Statistics/2.Analyze-Experiment-Results.ipynb)

### Part 3: Data Wrangling
Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.

- Project: [Wrangle and Analyze Data](https://github.com/fmahlmeister/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/3.Data-Wrangling/3.Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data.ipynb)

### Part 4: Data Visualization with Python
Learn to apply visualization principles to the data analysis process. Explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.

- Project: [Communicate Data Findings](https://github.com/fmahlmeister/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/4.Data-Visualization-with-Python/4.Communicate-Data-Findings.ipynb)
