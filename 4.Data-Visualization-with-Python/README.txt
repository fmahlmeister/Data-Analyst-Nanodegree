1. Which dataset you chose. If not part of Udacity's dataset options, document the source of your data.

	I used the Flights Dataset from Udacity's suggestion
	source: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html


2. Main findings from the exploratory data analysis, and how you chose the results to put in your explanatory analysis.

	Despite the US has 347 airports, most of the traffic is concentrated in a few airports. We were able to investigate further what's these airports are and who are the major airlines operating at them.
	
	During this project I drove the exploratory analysis to answer the 3 main objectives of this project:

	1. Explore which is the airport with the highest traffic
	2. How much the traffic increased over the years?
	3. Which are the most used routes?

	So, I chose the graphs which represent the most these main objectives to put in my explanatory analysis.

3. If you obtained feedback from others for your explanatory designs, document them here.
	
	I didn't get any feedback from others

4. List of resources used during the creation of the project. This includes web sites, books, forums, blog posts, and GitHub repositories.
